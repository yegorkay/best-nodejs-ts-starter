## Why is it the best?

- I made it :heavy_check_mark:
- This repo can be anything other than an express server :scream_cat:
- Infinitely customizable :art:

You hate the prettier config?

- Read some of the [Prettier docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html)

You hate the eslint config?

- Read the [ESLint docs](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)

You hate the precommit hooks?

- Read up on the [lint-staged docs](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and [Husky docs](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)

The CI doesn't suit your needs?

- Read the [Github Action docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

You don't like TypeScript?

- Convert all the `.ts` extensions into `.js` extensions
- Uninstall all `@types` from `package.json`
- Uninstall all eslint typescript libraries from `package.json`
- Delete the `tsconfig.json`, maybe make a `jsconfig.json` if you must
- Change the start script to `node index.js`
- Congrats, you're playing JavaScript on hard mode!
